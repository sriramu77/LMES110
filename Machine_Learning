Machine Learning ---->

It is the process of letting the machine to train on specific
data and produce result with the knowledge gained on training.

Machine ----> Program ----> Algorithm(data read)

When you feed some historical data to the machine (program or algorithm) and let that to
get trained.

Libraries ---> Reading the File ----> Training on the data ----> Testing the data --->
checking the accuracy

Libraries:

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

Supervised_Learning:

Input: x data or feature data or independent data(columns)
Output: y data or target data or dependent data(columns)

all the above input and output will be in the file that we might use

Case Study:

1. We can either decide the target by our own or some time client will tell you
what needs to be found out.

1.1 After deciding what is our target. we should see how our target looks like
        Regression:

        Price: 2000,3000,4000,5000 (Regression)

        Classification:

            Binary Classification:
                    Cancer: Yes or No

            Multi Classification:
                      Player_Type: WK or B or Bow or A

1.2 After choosing the target, focus on the input and see how its stands on the output

              Year   Sq_Feet Price
              2000      100     10000
              2001      110     15000
              2002      130     20000

2. We can choose all the other as x data or we can only few as x data.

2.1 on what basis we should choose x data.
2.2 for choosing x data we have few inbuilt library or methods to find.
    2.2.1. Feature Selection

Linear Regression:

Linear Regression model will be used when our output is continuous data
and input data is having linear relationship.
